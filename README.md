# Creating webapps with Binder with Seaborn and other useful dependencies

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/appmode/master?urlpath=apps%2Findex.ipynb)

This repository demonstrates how to create webapps with Binder. This is similar to how Shiny apps work in R.
Using the `appmode` Jupyter plugin, a notebook's code will be run, and then only the markdown cells and
code outputs will be shown.

**POST-FORKING DIFFERENCES**  
I added seaborn and other useful dependencies after forking this from [here](https://github.com/binder-examples/appmode).

You can check out the `appmode` repository here: https://github.com/oschuett/appmode
